1. What does the project do?

This PhD thesis sheds light on the intersection between secondary vegetation dynamics and the strategies for promoting long-lasting forest restoration with socioeconomic outcomes derived from innovative agroecological food production systems in the landscape level.
I evaluated the spatiotemporal patterns of secondary vegetation dynamics in Pará, under the light of the Forest Transition Theory, and the reasoning for agroecological transitions in its Northeastern mesoregion, under the light of the Theory of Change.


2. Why is the project useful?

2.1. Large-Scale Potential for Rehabilitation:
Pará, being the second-largest state in the Brazilian Amazon and covering over 1.2 million km², offers significant opportunities for both natural regeneration and productive forest rehabilitation at scale. This makes it a critical region for implementing sustainable land-use practices that can have far-reaching environmental and socioeconomic impacts.

2.2. Intersection of Forest Rehabilitation and Secondary Vegetation Dynamics:
The thesis provides a comprehensive perspective by bridging forest rehabilitation with secondary vegetation dynamics. This intersection is vital for understanding how degraded lands can be restored effectively while generating ecological and economic benefits.

2.3. Insights for Sustainable Land Use Practices and Policy Design:
The research delivers actionable insights into sustainable land use practices, which are directly applicable to policy design. These insights can improve and integrate various initiatives, such as:

- Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) : Enhancing ecosystem services through restoration.
- Carbon Credits : Supporting carbon sequestration efforts and contributing to global climate goals.
- Biodiversity Credits : Promoting biodiversity conservation in rehabilitated areas.
- Sustainable Livelihoods : Ensuring that local communities benefit economically from restoration activities.

2.3. Promotion of Long-Lasting Ecosystem Recovery:
By emphasizing long-term recovery, the project contributes to the establishment of ecological corridors, which enhance connectivity between fragmented forests. This is essential for preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem resilience.

2.4. Understanding Complex Interactions:
The study highlights the importance of understanding the intricate relationships between ecological, socioeconomic, and institutional factors. This holistic approach ensures that agroecological transitions in tropical regions are not only scientifically sound but also socially equitable and institutionally feasible.

2.5. Relevance to Broader Goals:
The findings align with broader global objectives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement, by promoting climate mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and improved livelihoods.

In summary, the project is highly relevant and impactful because it addresses critical challenges in one of the world's most ecologically important regions while offering practical solutions for sustainable development and ecosystem restoration.


3. How users can get started with the project? 

The results of my thesis feed scientific theories while providing insights for regional policies in Pará state, Brazil. The simplified stakeholders’ engagement methodology can be employed in different participatory contexts aiming to build consensus between different social groups. 
While a whole thesis is a dense material to access, and my research papers are still in progress to fit top-tier scientific journals, I developed this GitHub to help users navigate the findings and to produce insights for future research and developmental projects.

4. Where users can get help with their project?

Looking for collaboration in topics such as Bioeconomy and Environmental Management? I developed innovative approaches bridging qualitative and quantitative research methods and this might worth reaching out. I am always open to collaborations!
